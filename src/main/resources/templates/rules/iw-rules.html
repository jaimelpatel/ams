                            1. Cash teams are used for both cash matches and tournaments with NLG Cash being the currency used for both ($1.00 NLG Cash = $1.00 USD). Tournament seeding is
                            completely random so that a teamâ€™s current record will have no impact on their seeding.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            2. Cash teams have the ability to turn on/off the XP gain/loss calculator for their wager and tournaments games before they are played. Turning off this feature is not recommended unless the team is already highly ranked on the leaderboards and you want to play a wager match or tournament without fear of moving lower on the leaderboards. 
                            Cash teams are ranked by their total XP just like XP teams are.(This setting can be accessed through the edit team function)
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            3. Each user may be on up to 3 cash teams in the same ladder (Example of a ladder: North America - Call of Duty: World War 2 - Playstation 4 - Doubles). 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            4. NLG takes a comission from every cash match and tournament played.
                            
                                                        <br/>
                            <br/>
                            5. All players playing in a tournament or cash match must accept their tournament/cash match invite in order to make their team eligible for play.
                        </div>
                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="vtab1">
                            1. Players must have a valid PSN or Xbox Gamer tag linked to their NLGO account
                            (Spelling and spaces must be exact). To set your account sign in above and click <a th:href="@{/account}">here</a>.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            2. You can change the PSN or Xbox Gamer tag associated with your account. However,
                            doing so will result in that user being ineligible for the next 4 hours on the ladders that
                            the change applies to (Example: changing a PSN will only make that user ineligible for
                            PSN games, it will not affect Xbox game eligibility).
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            3. Players can be on two cash teams at once and are allowed unlimited team changes. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            4. Players can only have one pending/active match at a time, this means you will not be able
                            to post/accept matches from two teams at the same time. NLGO blocks users from
                            competing in multiple matches at the same time.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            5. Once a team leader has created/accepted a match, all members of that team must also
                            accept the match for it to become active.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            6. Players must be 18 years or older to compete in cash matches or cash tournaments.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            7. Players competing in any NLG tournament, must be a resident of the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Canada. Players must not be a resident of the state of Arizona, Connecticut, Maryland or the territory of Quebec. 
                                                        <br/>
                            <br/>
                            8. Each player playing in a tournament or cash match has to accept their cash match or tournament invite in order to play and make their team eligible for play.
                        </div>
                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="vtab2">
                            1. If a team disagrees with the connection, the hosting team must switch hosts until a reasonable host is found. Teams cannot deny such request without risking an automatic forfeit of the map. Your team is to acquire proof of requesting a host change and the opposing team denying your request and should leave immediately after acquiring such proof and then submit a Dispute claim with that proof provided.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            2. If a player disconnects during a kill-dependent game mode (e.g. Search and Destroy), the round must be completed. Upon completing the round, the host can end the game or the non-hosting team can switch teams in the first ten seconds of the next round at which
                            point the host must end the game and wait for the player to reconnect to the lobby within 5 minutes. The map will be replayed from the round count when the host ended the game. After the 5 minutes given to the player to reconnect, the host may start the match with or without the player that disconnected from the last completed round. In the event of a host drop, the same rules apply.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            3. If a player disconnects during a non kill-dependent game mode (e.g. Hardpoint), the host can end the game or the non-hosting team can switch teams at which point the host must end the game and wait for the player to reconnect to the lobby within 5 minutes. The map will be replayed from the amount of points when the host ended the game. After the 5 minutes given to the player to reconnect, the host may start the match with or without the player that disconnected from the map. In the event of a host drop, the same rules apply.
                        </div>
                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="vtab3">
                            1. The host is the player who must create the custom game and ensure that the proper
                            settings and map are used (Check game specific rules for more information on the setting
                            requirements). The host should set their party player limit to match the number of players
                            for the specified match if possible. (Example: Player Limit 8 for a 4 vs 4 match)
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            2. The team that hosts the first game has the responsibility of adding a member of the
                            opposing team. All matches are required to start within 10 minutes of their scheduled
                            time, this is known as the grace period (Example: if a match is scheduled to start at 1:30
                            pm, all players must be in the lobby and ready to start at 1:40 pm). The second and third
                            game must start within 5 minutes of the previous games ending.
                            <br/>
                            <p style="margin-left:50px"><br/>a. If the hosting team does not send a game invite to the opposing team they risk
                                forfeiting the match.</p>
                            <p style="margin-left:50px">b. If the hosting team delays the sending of game invites to the opposing team until
                                the very end of the 10-minute grace period, the opposing team will still have 5
                                additional minutes to join the match.</p>
                            <br/>
                            3. For a best of 3, the lower seeded team at match time must host the first game. The higher
                            seeded team will host the second game. If a tie breaker game is required, the team with
                            the most combined search and destroy rounds or variant game mode points for all games
                            leading up to the tie breaker will host the tie breaker match.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            4. For search and destroy, the hosting team must spawn in on offense at the start of the
                            match. This means that the non-hosting team must spawn in on defense. If a player
                            spawns in on the incorrect team and is unable to spawn in on the correct team, the host
                            must restart the match. If this issue occurs more than once, the host can refuse to restart
                            the match.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            5. For all other game modes, the non-hosting team gets to choose their spawn. This means
                            the hosting team must go to the opposite side. If a player spawns in on the incorrect team
                            and is unable to spawn in on the correct team, the host must restart the match. If this issue
                            occurs more than once, the host can refuse to restart the match.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            6. Outside Players/Spectators: After a custom game has been created, only eligible Players
                            on the two Teams and Staff members may be invited/join. If an ineligible player joins and
                            affects the game and/or doesn't leave within 30 seconds of joining, the game must be
                            ended. If a player is found to have invited an ineligible player to a game, they will forfeit
                            the game.
                        </div>

                        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="vtab4">
                            1. Teams and players found to be incorrectly reporting matches will be subject to

                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            2. Users that incorrectly choose a region/time zone to gain a competitive advantage will be
                            suspended.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            3. Breaking any rule and any form of cheating, glitching, and abusing in-game mechanics
                            may result in a forfeit of a game.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            4. Users may not allow others to play on their accounts during an NLGO match.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            5. Players who move their character outside of the normal boundaries of a map may forfeit
                            the game. Moving outside of the normal boundaries of a map includes but is not limited
                            to part of the characterâ€™s body passing through what should be a non-permeable surface
                            or object, and moving into any area from which your character registers shots on an
                            opponent who is not able to register shots on your character.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            6. Settings: For Search and Destroy, the hosting team will forfeit all rounds where the
                            incorrect setting(s) affected the game. If a game is hosted out of order, the hosting team
                            will forfeit the game that was played out of order. For example, if Search and Destroy -
                            Overgrown is the second game and played as the first game, the hosting team will forfeit
                            Search and Destroy - Overgrown. The first game will still need to be played.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            7. Restricted Items: For Search and Destroy, the use of any restricted items will result in the
                            loss of the rounds that the items were used if gameplay was affected. For respawn game
                            modes, the use of restricted items will result in a loss of the current game being played.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            8. Premature Game Ending: Teams that force a game to end prematurely by players
                            switching teams, leaving the game, inviting outside players, and/or the host ending the
                            game may result in the loss of the round for Search and Destroy and the loss of the game
                            for respawn modes.
                            <br/>

                            9. Equipment: The use of a keyboard/mouse during a Ps4 or Xbox One match is prohibited.
                            Additionally, the use of a controller with turbo or macro buttons is also prohibited. The
                            use of these items will result in losses for games in which they were used and the user
                            guilty of this behavior may be suspended.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            10. The use of a modified console, hacks, or mods is strictly prohibited and will result in a
                            loss of the current match and disqualification of that team from their respective ladder.
                            The player responsible will be suspended from NLGO.

                            through any medium.
                            <br/>

                            12. Disqualification: Some actions may result in immediate disqualification from a cash
                            match or tournament and may result in that user being banned from NLGO. Examples of
                            behavior or actions that could result in this include but are not limited to, physical acts
                            violence, cheating, collusion/manipulating the bracket, drug/substance abuse on-site, any
                            illegal activities, betting or gambling on a tournament or match results, hate speech, and
                            harassment.

                            <br/>
                            2. Proof must be provided to the extent that a clear decision can be made when determining
                            the winner. For example, screenshots should be clearly visible and contain the game

                            link from a third-party website such as YouTube. Ensure that your uploads are NOT

                            <br/>
                            4. Make sure that the issue of the dispute is clear and that the support staff is aware of what
                            they are looking for in the provided proof. This includes letting the staff know at what
                            time in a video the issue occurs.
                            <br/>

                            5. When a match is disputed, both teams will have 24 hours to submit a claim before the
                            match is reviewed.
                            <br/>

                            7. Tournaments will have live support and expedited ticket resolution to help maintain the
                            pace of play.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            8. If a cash team/user does not agree with the outcome of a dispute claim they have the
                            ability to escalate this claim two more times, at which point the decision made by NLGO
                            staff regarding the match will be final.
                            <br/>

                            1. Certain games and ladders (Call of Duty: World War 2 as of now) will have seasons that allow users to qualify for a cash prize
                            playoff. You can read more about NLG playoffs <a th:href="@{/news/playoffs}"> here</a>.

                            <br/>
                            2. Playoffs will include the top teams from both the XP and cash ladders that fall under the
                            same game, team size, and platform.

                            1. Cash teams are used for both cash matches and tournaments. Tournament seeding is
                            completely random so that a teamâ€™s current record will have no impact on their seeding.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            2. Cash teams have the ability to allow/disallow tournaments and cash matches to have an effect on their ladder ranking by not giving/taking xp on a win or loss of a match. (This setting can be
                            accessed through the edit team function). Cash teams are entered into playoffs same as XP teams so their ranking does matter!
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            3. Once tournament registration is closed, teams will be assigned a random seed. Seed 1 is
                            the highest seed.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            4. All first round matches will start at the same time. After the first round, matches will
                            have a unique start time that is determined by the time that a team submits its previous
                            match score. Delaying the start time of a match unless authorized by a NLGO staff
                            member is not permitted and could result in a forfeit.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            5. If a match is not played and neither team submits a dispute claim for a no show, both
                            teams will be forfeited from the tournament.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            6. If you have any problems/concerns while playing a tournament contact live support to
                            help resolve these issues.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            7. The prize value listed for all tournaments is based upon registration capacity being full. If
                            a tournament starts and is not at capacity, prize values will be adjusted proportionally.
