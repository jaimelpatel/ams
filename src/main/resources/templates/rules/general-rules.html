                                            2. Default Start Time: All Round 1 Matches have the same default start time. After Round 1, all Matches have a unique default start time that is dependent upon the time at which the Teams’ previous Round results were submitted. Matches must be started by their default start time and played until completion. Postponing matches is only at the discretion of Online Tournament staff.

                                            1. Definition: The Host is the Player who must create the Custom Game and ensure that the proper Settings and Map are used. The Host should set their party player limit to match the number of players for the specified match. (Example: Player Limit 8 for a 4 vs 4 match.)
                                            <br></br>

                                            2. Host and Side Choice for each Game: The higher seeded team at match time must host the first game. The lower seeded team will host the second game. This will alternate until a tie breaker game is required. The team with the higher combined Search and Destroy rounds won for all games leading up to the tie breaker in that match will host the tie breaker game. The teat that does not host must choose a side to play on.

                                            3. Procedure: Hosting Players should create the Custom Game. As the hosting Team changes over the course of a Match, the new hosting Player should leave the Custom Game and create a new one. A lag test should be performed before the start of each game to ensure all players have an acceptable player to player connection.
                                            <br></br>
                                            <br></br>
                                            4. Finish Games: If a player’s connection to the server becomes unreasonable during a game, the Game must still be played. The lag incident should be reported to tournament support immediately following that game.
                                            <br></br>
                                            <br></br>
                                            5. Incorrect Ending: If the Host incorrectly ends a Game, their Team may Forfeit the Game.                    </div>

                                            1. Delays: Teams may not delay the start of a Match beyond its scheduled start time, without the approval of a Tournament Official. Teams may delay a Match between Games for up to five minutes. Teams can request that a Tournament Official enforce this five minute time limit. After five minutes of a Tournament Official enforced delay, if the delaying Team does not have the minimum required Players, they will Forfeit the Match.
                                            <br></br>
                                            <br></br>
                                            2. Minimum Required Players: Teams may only be short handed by one player in order to start a Search and Destroy Game. A Team will Forfeit the Match if they are missing more than one player than the match specifies by 15 minutes after a Match’s default start time (Grace Period). Teams will be forced to start a Game at the end of a Grace Period.
                                            <br></br>
                                            <br></br>
                                            3. Disconnections: Search and Destroy Games must be restarted if a Player disconnects in the first 30 seconds and before the first kill. If a Player disconnects from a Search and Destroy Game after the first 30 seconds or after the first kill, the Game must continue and the Player may rejoin the Game.
                                            <br></br>
                                            <br></br>
                                            4. Normal Boundaries: Players who move their Character outside of the normal boundaries of a Map may Forfeit the Game. Moving outside of the normal boundaries of a Map includes but is not limited to part of the Character’s body passing through what should be a non-permeable surface or object, and moving into any area from which your Character registers shots on an opponent who is not able to register shots on your Character.
                                            <br></br>
                                            <br></br>
                                            5. Outside Players/Spectators: After a Custom Game has been created, only eligible Players on the two Teams and Staff members may be invited/join. If an ineligible Player joins a Game, the Game must be ended if the player affects the game and/or doesn't leave within 30 seconds of joining. If a Player is found to have invited an ineligible Player to a Game, they will Forfeit the Game.                    </div>

                                            1. No Shows: The No Show grace period time is listed on your match page. When the time is up you must report all no shows to Live Support. In order to contact a Tournament Official use Live Support which is at the bottom right of every tournament and match page. The tournament official will then send the opposing team a 5 minute warning message before forfeiting them from the match. The Ticket must include proof that their opponent did not show. Select "I'm reporting: my opponent did not show" under “Report Problem” on the Match page.
                                            <br></br>

                                            2. Time Limit: Both teams must report the Match results within 10 minutes of its completion. Failure to report the Match results on time may result in a Forfeit.
                                            <br></br>

                                            3. Lag: You must report lag as soon as it happens. If you report the lag to Live Support immediatly we will have the round that lagged replayed. Continuing to play will result in you accepting the scores of the game and the lag. We may only have the most recent round that lag replayed.
